    <p>Although I am really busy right now, preparing my position for a new job (I will write more about this sometime later) you have to relax from time to time. If you like relaxing with a good game at hand, then check out <a href="http://www.rochardthegame.com/de/">Rochard</a> <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/107800/?snr=1_7_15__13">on steam</a>. That is a nice little but great puzzle platformer utilizing the space miners version of an swiss army knife combining a gravity manipulator, a gravity inverter and a multi bullet cannon.</p>

<p>Rochard is playing in a texan / western styled universe, a bit like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/?ref_=sr_1">Firefly</a>. It starts of with great music from one of my favorite bands <a href="http://www.poetsofthefall.com/">Poets of the Fall</a> who also wrote the Soundtrack for the first <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/maxpayne">Max Payne</a>. Introducing you as John Rochard, an unlucky space miner employed by the Skyrig Corporation on a space mining facility in some asteroid field in the middle of nowhere (no that one <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=nowhere+oklahoma">in oklahoma</a> ;-)). After discovering an alien artifact, and his team gone missing the facility gets attacked by bandits and John is finding himself in a story of intrigues, puzzles and casual shootouts.</p>

<p>The game is fun to play, not too long, the story is really entertaining and well told, but the puzzles could be a bit more difficult for my taste. The jokes are great and you feel how much love the developers put into the details. And the southern Blues/Rock music really creates the right atmosphere. And for a bit of more long term engagement, you can collect some nice steam badges.</p>

<p>I bought it in a sale on steam, and it was really worth it.</p>
