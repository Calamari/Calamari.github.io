Although I am really busy right now, preparing my position for a new job (I will write more about this sometime later) you have to relax from time to time. If you like relaxing with a good game at hand, then check out [Rochard][Rochard] [on steam][RochardSteam]. That is a nice little but great puzzle platformer utilizing the space miners version of an swiss army knife combining a gravity manipulator, a gravity inverter and a multi bullet cannon.

Rochard is playing in a texan / western styled universe, a bit like [Firefly][Firefly]. It starts of with great music from one of my favorite bands [Poets of the Fall][PotF] who also wrote the Soundtrack for the first [Max Payne][Payne]. Introducing you as John Rochard, an unlucky space miner employed by the Skyrig Corporation on a space mining facility in some asteroid field in the middle of nowhere (no that one [in oklahoma][nowhere] ;-)). After discovering an alien artifact, and his team gone missing the facility gets attacked by bandits and John is finding himself in a story of intrigues, puzzles and casual shootouts.

The game is fun to play, not too long, the story is really entertaining and well told, but the puzzles could be a bit more difficult for my taste. The jokes are great and you feel how much love the developers put into the details. And the southern Blues/Rock music really creates the right atmosphere. And for a bit of more long term engagement, you can collect some nice steam badges.

I bought it in a sale on steam, and it was really worth it.
